            <h3 id="passion">How I Found my Passion During a Global Pandemic</h3>
            <p id="journey"> I graduated from Westside High School in 2019 where I was a staff writer for 
                the school newspaper and volunteered to help students learn pottery after school.
                In 2020 I studied Aviation at UNO after Covid shut down in-person learning I took some time 
                off from UNO in Fall 2021 and I fell in love with coding and began learning by watching
                online tutorials. As of Spring 2021 I began taking courses at AIM Code School with a concentration 
                in Full-Stack Java Development. I never expected to find my passion during a global pandemic
                but I'm thrilled that I did.
